            <h2>- - - The World of Travelling - - -</h2>
            <p>Travelling means going from one place to another in different purposes. Seeking to explore, to see the unseen and know the unknown. For travellers always travel the most beautiful places of the world which uphold the existence of nature.</p>
      
            <p>For the educative value of travelling beggars description. For if a man stays at one place for a long time, he becomes monotonous and his life becomes boring and callous. Travelling removes our monotony and gives pleasure. Similarly, it also broadens our outlook and refreshes our mind. A good traveler can easily educate others. He can give us first-hand knowledge of men and matters of other country.</p>
      
            <p>Nobody can under-estimate the educational value of travelling.  Travelling is a better teacher than books.  It confirms one's bookish and theoretical knowledge.  It helps us to learn things in an easier, more lasting and more lucid manner.  Think of a student who has actually seen the Taj.  Is he not much better placed to write about the Taj than any of his class-fellows who has never been to Agra? Travelling gives first- hand information about things places, persons and events.  IT provides an opportunity for acquiring practical knowledge of men and matters and enables a person to fight the battle of life in a more successful way. Travelling is essential for the healthy growth of the mind.  Tagore write : "The health of the mind cannot be maintained on the ration of books served up in motionless classes within the prison walls of a static school." </p>
      
            <p>Travelling converts a student into a awakened scholar in the open university of the world.  He is able to have a close look at life, grapple with its varied problems and have a first- hand knowledge of the affairs of the world.  Knowledge obtained through books is incomplete, imperfect and short-lived.  Knowledge obtained through travelling is perfect and permanent.</p>
      
            <p>One who has not travelled, remains like a frog in a well.  He is a self-centered.  He thinks that his view-point is the only correct view-point.  He cannot appreciate the view point of others.  He is a prisoner of his set ideas.  A widely travelled person, on the other hand, comes in contact with numerous persons.  Thus he gets a new vision of life.  His outlook become broad; his sympathies widen.  He comes to realize that the view-point of others may also be correct..........</p>
